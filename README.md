# Personal projects to showcase for api.video tech talks

* `Quompressor` : an image compressor that leverage image
  segmentation techniques (like qtree AST and color quantization).
  This project is a Rust codebase to illustrate the language capabilities
  in the context of an internal tech talk. While being a tech talk, we
  still want to talk about image/video compression-based project.
